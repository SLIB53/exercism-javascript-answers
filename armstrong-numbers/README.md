# Armstrong Numbers

An [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

- 9 is an Armstrong number, because `9 = 9^1 = 9`
- 10 is *not* an Armstrong number, because `10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1`
- 153 is an Armstrong number, because: `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153`
- 154 is *not* an Armstrong number, because: `154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190`
