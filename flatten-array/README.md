# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.

For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ yarn test
```
